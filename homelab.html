  <p class="lead">
    I have a bunch of computers networked together that I call a homelab. It's not very high budget, and in fact most of it is hand-me-down or scavenged from the trash <span class="text-muted">(and subsequently disinfected)</span>. But it works for my needs.

    <h3>Main computer: HP Omen 15 (2017)</h3>
    <p>A hand-me-down laptop from a friend of mine who was upgrading. It's fairly large, so I don't carry it around with me. There's a billion cables attached at all times anyway, so it would be a huge pain.</p>
    <p>One of these days I'd like to build my own beast of a computer, but it's not like I'm keeping up with any triple-A game titles these days, so what I have works fine.</p>

    <h4>Notes</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>I use both the integrated and discrete GPU since I have it connected to two monitors: a Huion Kamvas display tablet and some Viewsonic monitor. The Huion is mounted to this swivel arm thingy so I can pull it from a typical monitor position down to my desk to draw on it.</li>
      <li>The SSD was originally a measly 120 GB boot drive, which started to fail after a while so I replaced it with a 1TB one.</li>
      <li>I upgraded the RAM from 8 to 16 GB after my travel laptop's RAM failed, and I bought a 2x8 GB kit and stick an extra 8 GB in this one.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Home server: Lenovo Ideapad Y50-70</h3>
    <p>My home server is also a hand-me-down laptop, this time from my family. A laptop might be an unusual choice for a server, but I like to think of it as a server with a built in UPS and monitor, which has come in handy every now and then. It's quiet enough that I can sleep next to it daily, which is important since I live in a microscopic studio apartment.</p>

    <h3>Travel Computer: Lenovo Thinkpad X260</h3>
    <p>A trusty Thinkpad that's small enough to carry around. I used to have a L420 which was massive and broke my back every time I had to lug it around.</p>

    <h3>3D printer server: Samsung Galaxy S4</h3>
    <p>It runs octo4a, an Android port of Octoprint, and is connected to an Ender 3 I found in the trash.</p>
