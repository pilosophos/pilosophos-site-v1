    I have a bunch of computers networked together that I call a homelab. It's not very high budget, and in fact most of it is hand-me-down or scavenged from the trash <span class="text-muted">(and subsequently disinfected)</span>. But it works for my needs.

      Main computer: HP Omen 15 (2017)
    </h3>

    <p>A hand-me-down laptop from a friend of mine who was upgrading. It's fairly large, so I don't carry it around with me. There's a billion cables attached at all times anyway, so it would be a huge pain.</p>
    <p>One of these days I'd like to build my own beast of a computer, but it's not like I'm keeping up with any triple-A game titles these days, so what I have works fine.</p>

    <h4>Notes</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>I use both the integrated and discrete GPU since I have it connected to two monitors: a Huion Kamvas display tablet and some Viewsonic monitor. The Huion is mounted to this swivel arm thingy so I can pull it from a typical monitor position down to my desk to draw on it.</li>
      <li>The SSD was originally a measly 120 GB boot drive, which started to fail after a while so I replaced it with a 1TB one.</li>
      <li>I bought a 2x8 GB kit and added a sick to the server after my travel laptop's RAM failed, bringing my server from 8 to 16 GB.</li>

      Home server: Lenovo Ideapad Y50-70
    </h3>
    <p>
      My home server is also a hand-me-down laptop, this time from my family. A laptop might be an unusual choice for a server, but I like to think of it as a server with a built in UPS and monitor*, which has come in handy every now and then. It's quiet enough that I can sleep next to it daily, which is important since I live in a microscopic studio apartment.
      <aside class="small">* I later discovered the battery had become what's known as a Spicy Pillow (technical term), so that had to go.</aside>

    <h4>Services</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Owncloud</li>
      <li>Personal wiki (Mediawiki)</li>
      <li>Two Airsonic instances</li>
      <li>Two Szurubooru instances</li>
      <li>Minecraft server (Aug-Nov 2023: Enigmatica 6 Expert)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Notes</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>The server recieved a RAM upgrade from 8 to 16 GB after I started hosting a Enigmatica 6 Expert server, which consumes a ridiculous amount of RAM. I actually don't think this is enough, especially with the other services running. I don't want to spend even <em>more</em> money, so I increased the swapfile to 6 GB which at least keeps it from OOMing.</li>

      Travel Computer: Lenovo Thinkpad X260
    </h3>
    <p>A trusty Thinkpad that's small enough to carry around. I used to have an L420 which was massive and broke my back every time I had to lug it around. Shame it doesn't have the old style keyboards which were way nicer to type on.</p>

      3D printer server: Samsung Galaxy S4 (+Ender 3)
    </h3>
    <p>
      I found an Ender 3 in the trash in my apartment building, believe it or not. It had a BL Touch bed leveling probe (incorrectly wired) and the power supply set to the wrong voltage. It hadn't been used in a long time, judging by the dust all around it. Turns out it works if you just flip the voltage switch, and swap a couple wires on the BL Touch cable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The funny thing is, just the month before, I thought I'd get into 3D printing by getting a secondhand MP Mini Delta. So if I'd just waited a month, I wouldn't have spent all that extra for an inferior printer that I'm not using anymore.
    </p>
    <p>
      The server that runs the Ender 3 is a Galaxy S4 with <a href="https://github.com/feelfreelinux/octo4a">octo4a</a>, a port of OctoPrint for Android. I used to use the phone as a daily driver, but it feels pretty sluggish now even with optimized LineageOS on it.

      <p>An HP desktop workstation I got at a surplus store, which was my home server before I started living alone. Has a 4TB SAS drive and Dell PERC H310 flashed to IT mode. Since I live in a studio now and the server is very loud (especially with the SAS drive), I haven't used it since I moved.</p>
