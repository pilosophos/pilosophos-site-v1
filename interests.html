    When I meet people I like to ask about their hobbies and interests. It's much more fun than talking about what you do for a living, so if you meet me, ask about these things!

      Worldbuilding
    </h3>

    <p>
      I've been a part of and have run a few collaborative worldbuilding projects. Many of my hobbies and interests were picked up because I wanted to improve my worldbuilding, so I owe worldbuilding a great deal.
    </p>
    <p>
      My worldbuilding originally started because of <a href="https://www.nationstates.net/">NationStates</a>, and while I don't play anymore, I'm still worldbuilding. And strangely, I have never DM'd a TTRPG campaign.
    </p>

    <h4>My favorite worlds I've built are:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://nspbcanon.miraheze.org/wiki/Malaszec"><img src="{{ '/assets/images/malaszec-flag.png' | relative_url }}" class="icon-16 me-1" role="presentation"></img> Malaszec</a>, a magical cyberpunk country having emerged from the collapse of an authoritarian regime and struggling to integrate faeries, elves, and humans into a ruthless corporatocracy.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://pilosophos.github.io/the-federal-constellation/"><img src="{{ '/assets/images/federal-constellation-flag.png' | relative_url }}" class="icon-16 me-1" role="presentation"></img> The Federal Constellation</a>, a supranational space union founded by two alien worlds each on the other side of a shared wormhole, around which both home planets orbit.
      </li>
    </ul>

      Conlanging
    </h3>
    <p>
      At some point as I was worldbuilding, I asked myself <i>"how come I'm making up imaginary people and places, but they all inexplicably speak English?"</i> It was at this point I picked up conlanging. At around the same time, I'd been learning Latin, which is invariably taught from a philological perspective rather than trying to get students to use it in their daily life, which gave me my initial exposure to linguistics. Conlanging is the main reason why I got a linguistics degree.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of my most developed conlangs is <a href="https://nspbcanon.miraheze.org/wiki/Malaszec_language">Malaszec</a>, which you might have guessed is the language spoken in Malaszec, one of my worldbuilding projects.

      Technology
    </h3>
    <p>
      Originally I just wanted to make cool things and show them to my friends. I do this for a living now, and miraculously I'm not burned out enough to stop doing it for fun.
    </p>
    <p>
      I mostly do web programming in JavaScript etc., since everyone has access to a web browser these days. My favorite language is Python, but I have experience in Java <span class="text-muted">(mainly because of Minecraft and uni)</span>, Lua <span class="text-muted">(because of Computercraft and World of Warcraft)</span>, and a bunch of others I don't use very often. I've made Discord bots, scripts I use to help me do conlanging and learn natural languages, plugins for Minecraft servers, and a whole bunch more.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also have a <a href="{{ '/homelab.html' | relative_url }}">home lab</a> which I cram into my tiny little apartment, filled mostly with hand-me-down hardware and stuff I found in the trash <span class="text-muted">(and subsequently disinfected)</span>. I'm trying to get into wearable development, as well as embedded systems <span class="text-muted">(e.g. arduinos, esp8266)</span> which I try to kitbash with salvaged parts from broken old printers and stuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm also on <a href="https://tilde.town">tilde.town</a> as ~pilosophos. If you're viewing the tilde.town mirror of this site, I guess you already knew that. If you're <em>on</em> tilde.town, you should sign my guestbook!

      Drawing
    </h3>

    </figure>

    <p>
      My main styles are ink rendering <span class="text-muted">(particularly with fountain pens)</span>, sketches, and manga style cartoons. I'm probably best at landscapes, but I'm trying to get better at the human form. I like trying out a lot of different techniques, and as a result I haven't settled on a distinctive style yet, though I'd like to so I can set myself apart from other artists.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's hard to beat the convenience of digital art, so I use a Huion Kamvas tablet with Krita <span class="text-muted">(FOSS represent!)</span>. But there's something seductive about traditional media that makes it hard to let go of entirely. I have a bunch of fountain pens <span class="text-muted">(my first, and favorite, is the Pilot MP with the fine nib)</span> and inks, and I occasionally dabble in ink wash with watercolor brushes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arguably not "drawing," but I also do a lot of digital vector art in the form of logos and flags, primarily for my worldbuilding. I also do cartography in QGIS, which is probably overkill for worldbuilding but I do it anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
      I primarily post art on <a href="https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/77474454">Pixiv</a> these days. I used to post on DeviantArt, but at some point it started flagging random things as explicit content <span class="text-muted">(including a bunch flags and maps for some reason?)</span> and I got fed up with it, and I seem to get better engagement on Pixiv anyway.

      Gaming
    </h3>
    <p>I play a bunch of video games! I most enjoy strategy, racing, and sandbox games, though I can appreciate a good RPG. I have no allegiance towards PC versus console gaming, although I make it a point only to buy consoles that can be hacked.</p>

      * Just because it's my favorite doesn't necessarily mean I currently find it fun. Sometimes they're my favorite for nostalgia reasons, or because I admire the lore, or something else.
