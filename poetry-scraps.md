<p class="lead">Scraps of mediocre poetry</p>

### Untitled 1
feeling like the days will just never seem to end  
not enough energy, never time to play  
"never ending mystery," people just pretend,  
"what can we ever do? ain't another way"

thought it would be easy, but now my youth is over  
bank account gone negative, check if my mattress' spent  
tv says prosperity, but I don't even know her  
clocked in and I'm checked out, ain't even making rent
