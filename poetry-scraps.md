## Poetry scraps
<p class="lead">Scraps of mediocre poetry written by yours truly</p>

### Demon, Demon 2
feeling like the sky is falling
never know when god is calling
put your hands up to the air
and pray that judgement day is fair

demon, demon calling on your horsemen four
farewell children, it's the end
I'll be gone forever more

### Up late
my silent protest against the night sky  
still unwilling to say goodbye.  
by morning it's noon, and I'll wonder why  
I wasted an evening with a wistful sigh.

### Demon, Demon
demon, demon  
you've been knocking at my door  
I dare not take my eyes off you  
cuz' you shake me to my core

demon, demon  
I'll sleep with one eye open  
afraid of what you'll bring tomorrow  
followin' where I'm goin'

### Untitled 1
feeling like the days will just never seem to end  
not enough energy, never time to play  
"never ending mystery," people just pretend,  
"what can we ever do? ain't another way"

thought it would be easy, but now my youth is over  
bank account gone negative, check if my mattress' spent  
tv says prosperity, but I don't even know her  
clocked in and I'm checked out, ain't even making rent
