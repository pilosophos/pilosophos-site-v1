      <h4>TTT Type I "Carrot" trolley</h4>

      <p>
        The TTT Type I "Carrot" trolley was designed specifically for tilde.town transit and is the network's first train ever deployed. Its design was inspired by the trolleys on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_cable_car_system">San Francisco cable car system</a>, without the sideways-facing open-air seats.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is nicknamed the "Carrot" after its orange color, made primarily of Acacia wood planks.

      <h4>TTT Type II "Beet" trolley</h4>

      <p>
        While the Type I "Carrot" was originally deployed on the 2 Line during testing before line opened, the open-air driver cabin of the Carrot's design meant that monsters that spawned in the wilderness at night could attack the driver with arrows during operation. Thus, the Type II "Beet" was created with a fortified steel cabin to keep the driver safe.
      </p>

      <p>
        Since its maiden voyage in July 2024, the Beet has been retrofit with additional armor and more tightly covered windows.
