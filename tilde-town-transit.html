            The TTT Type II "Carrot" trolley was designed specifically for tilde.town transit and is the network's first train ever deployed. Its design was inspired by the trolleys on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_cable_car_system">San Francisco cable car system</a>, without the sideways-facing open-air seats.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is nicknamed the "Carrot" after its orange color, made primarily of Acacia wood planks.

          <p>
            While the Type II "Carrot" was originally deployed on the 2 Line during testing before line opened, the open-air driver cabin of the Carrot's design meant that monsters that spawned in the wilderness at night could attack the driver with arrows during operation. Thus, the Type III "Beet" was created with a fortified steel cabin to keep the driver safe.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since its maiden voyage in July 2024, the Beet has been retrofit with additional armor and more tightly covered windows due to <a href="https://minecraft.wiki/w/Difficulty#Regional_difficulty">increased crime levels</a>.

          ~pilosophos station was attached to ~pilosophos' factory after the construction of the ticket office and waiting area. It is the end of the 1 Line, although the track itself extends toward Rail Depot #1 (not accessible under normal service).

        <p>It was opened at the same time as ~nebula station at the opening of the tilde.town transit network, and was the first to be outfitted with an automated sentry turret to deal with monsters spawning at night.</p>

          ~nebula station is situated in the East of the ~nebula industrial town. The current station structures were built on top of a demolished refinery and power plant. It is the main hub of the tilde.town transit network, and is served by the 1, 2, and the upcoming 3 Lines, and allows transfer to the Teleporter Hub.
        </p>

        <p>On its grand opening on the 24th of June 2024, ~nebula station was located directly on top of the end of the Townshend Bridge, on the ~nebula side. The station was moved about a month later to its current location.</p>
