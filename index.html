      When I meet people I like to ask about their hobbies and interests. It's much more fun than talking about what you do for a living, so if you meet me, ask about these things!

        Worldbuilding
      </h4>
      <p>
        I've been a part of and have run a few collaborative worldbuilding projects. Many of my hobbies and interests were picked up because I wanted to improve my worldbuilding, so I owe worlbuilding a great deal.
      </p>
      <p>
        My worldbuilding originally started because of <a href="https://www.nationstates.net/">NationStates</a>, and while I don't play anymore, I'm still worldbuilding. And strangely, I have never DM'd a TTRPG campaign.
      </p>

      <h5>My favorite worlds I've built are:</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://nspbcanon.miraheze.org/wiki/Malaszec">Malaszec</a>, a magical cyberpunk country having emerged from the collapse of an authoritarian regime and struggling to integrate faeries, elves, and humans into a ruthless corporatocracy.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://pilosophos.github.io/the-federal-constellation/">The Federal Constellation</a>, a supranational space union founded by two alien worlds each on the other side of a shared wormhole, around which both home planets orbit.
        </li>
      </ul>

        Conlanging
      </h4>
      <p>
        At some point as I was worldbuilding, I asked myself <i>"how come I'm making up imaginary people and places, but they all inexplicably speak English?"</i> It was at this point I picked up conlanging. At around the same time, I'd been learning Latin, which is invariably taught from a philological perspective rather than trying to get students to use it in their daily life, which gave me my initial exposure to linguistics. Conlanging is the main reason why I got a linguistics degree.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of my most developed conlangs is <a href="https://nspbcanon.miraheze.org/wiki/Malaszec_language">Malaszec</a>, which you might have guessed is the language spoken in Malaszec, one of my worldbuilding projects.

        Programming
      </h4>
      <p>
        Originally I just wanted to make cool things and show them to my friends. I do this for a living now, and miraculously I'm not burned out enough to stop doing it for fun.
      </p>
      <p>
        I mostly do web programming in JavaScript etc., since everyone has access to a web browser these days. My favorite language is Python, but I have experience in Java (mainly because of Minecraft), Lua (because of Computercraft and World of Warcraft), and a bunch of others I don't use very often.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've made Discord bots, scripts I use to help me do conlanging and learn natural languages, plugins for Minecraft servers, and a whole bunch more.

        Drawing
      </h4>
      <p>
        My main styles are ink rendering <span class="muted">(particularly with fountain pens)</span>, sketches, and manga style cartoons. I'm probably best at landscapes, but I'm trying to get better at the human form. I like trying out a lot of different techniques, and as a result I haven't settled on a distinctive style yet, though I'd like to so I can set myself apart from other artists.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's hard to beat the convenience of digital art, so I use a Huion Kamvas tablet with Krita <span class="muted">(FOSS represent!)</span>. But there's something seductive about traditional media that makes it hard to let go of entirely. I have a bunch of fountain pens <muted>(my first, and favorite, is the Pilot MP with the fine nib)</muted> and inks, and I occasionally dabble in ink wash with watercolor brushes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Arguably not "drawing," but I also do a lot of digital vector art in the form of logos and flags, primarily for my worldbuilding. I also do cartography in QGIS, which is probably overkill for worldbuilding but I do it anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
        I primarily post art on <a href="https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/77474454">Pixiv</a> these days. I used to post on DeviantArt, but at some point it started flagging random things as explicit content (including a bunch flags and maps for some reason?) and I got fed up with it, and I seem to get better engagement on Pixiv anyway.
