God, how do I start this thing? I haven't had a diary since I was a kid. Am I supposed to be writing to someone?

You know sometimes you see those published diaries by people who are all long dead? Maybe on my deathbed I'll give someone the password to this thing and everyone in the future can read about my shitty life a hundred years later. That's not an exaggeration by the way. My life really is shitty.

About two months ago, I got reassigned to the Piss Corps by Boss Li because of a *liiiiittle* mistake of losing a key of coke on a run. Okay? Mistakes happen. So now of all the stinking duties I have to be stuck with, of course it's going to be my piss-poor luck that I'm stuck with the Piss Corps.

What the fuck do we do? Basically we spend all day scouting construction sites for Porta-potties, tracking big trucks with septics tanks around until we think they're full, and hijack them. Then we drive them over to wherever Jerry says to, and unload all the piss and shit into another septic tank. God knows what the point of all that is.

I tried asking Jerry what it's all supposed to be used for, but he wouldn't give me a straight answer. "Mind your business and do your job," he said. That's what he always says. Try to ask him anything― "How's it going?" or "Where are you from?" or "Where's the train station?"― and all he'll say is "Mind your business" or "Do your job" or both.

Someone should get him drunk one of these days. I bet he'll say some really dark shit. Maybe he gets off to torture porn or something really fucked up.

I tried asking Nybble, the guy who hacks the traffic cameras and stuff on our runs, what we're collecting all this shit for. But all he did was go, "You really don't know?" and scoff. He thinks he's better than us because he sits in his pajamas pushing buttons while we do all the real work on the street.

He's never shown his face either. I bet he's got a super punchable face, you know what I mean? The kind of face you take one look at and are instantly compelled to see fist meet nose. And I bet he has no idea what we do with this stuff either.

Rathead doesn't know but at least he's not a dick about it. He's a chill dude. He lets you borrow his lighter, and if you ask nicely he'll drive the truck if you're feeling it. But he's kind of wack-job though.

This one time we were playing Poker with Maddis and JC in the back room of Boss Li's Mahjong parlor, and out of the blue he jumps out of his chair shouting "Eureka!" and starts putting Pizza Rolls on one of those personal-sized frozen pizzas. It was his turn to bet.

That's not the end of it either. After taking it out of the toaster oven and about two minutes of eating this monstrosity, he leaps out of his chair *again* and comes back with a can of pineapple giggling like a madman. As he's dumping canned pineapple on his Pizza Roll pizza, he's all slack-jawed and looking in amazement like he's invented something revolutionary. He takes one bite and goes, "Duuuuude... this is gonna take over the world!!!"

The only person who seems to have any ideas about what we're doing with all this shit we steal is the new chick, Mara. She's really nice. Maybe a little too nice for her own good.

"They're probably selling it, right?" she says, "Like, you know when you flush the toilet it goes into the sewer? There's some facility it goes to and the water gets cleaned and then farms can use it to water crops and stuff." Man, if recycled piss-water is being used to water crops, no wonder food these days tastes like shit.

But even if you sell recycled sewage, I can't imagine it's really worth stealing. Who the hell is buying illegal sewage? I tried asking Mara but even she doesn't know. She just shrugged and said, "I'd love to know. Let me know if you find out, alright?"

I'm really curious now. Seriously, who's buying this stuff?
