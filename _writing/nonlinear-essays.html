  <h3>Cognition and learning are nonlinear</h3>
  <p>Oftentimes, learning about a topic or brainstorming an idea doesn't follow a linear path. If you've ever <a href="https://xkcd.com/214/">lost yourself for hours on Wikipedia</a> following links that look interesting, sometimes you go into depth learning about one thing, then you backtrack and learn some more about another thing you saw, and in the end you end up with a sprawling of web of related information.</p>

  <p>Or when you're brainstorming, you'll often have ideas and questions that pop up all at the same time, and so you'd write them all down, focus on one idea, then come back to another when you're done. And sometimes down the road you realize some ideas are related to each other, so ultimately everything's interconnected one way or another.</p>

  <p>If you're always railroaded into following a linear path, you wouldn't have the freedom to explore ideas as they come naturally. You couldn't jump around to stuff that interests you. It'd be like being forced to read recipe authors' life stories on cooking websites before you can read the recipe, or having to read the whole Wikipedia article before getting to the section you care about.</p>

  <h3>Essays should reflect how we think</h3>
  <p>If the way we arrive at some knowledge or an argument is nonlinear, why do we write essays about them linearly? Here we in the Age of Computers, yet all we can do is emulate the the same 5-paragraph essays we hated from grade school. Essays should reflect the way we think and how we get to the ideas that we have, and invite the reader to journey through those ideas just as naturally as we created them.</p>

  <p>Therefore I propose the idea of the <i>nonlinear essay</i>, where the connections between ideas being presented are visible up front, and readers can choose the order in which they read the text according to their interests.</strong></p>

  <p>In other words, A nonlinear essay gives readers the freedom to read what interests them the most in the moment. Standing at one part of the essay, they can visually see what other ideas are connected to the current one and <em>choose</em>. If they have burning questions about something and want to know more about a certain topic, they shouldn't have to wait for the author to explain some other idea and come back to it!</p>

  <h3>Nonlinearity is better for learning</h3>
  <p>Readers absorb knowledge better when they choose a path that makes the most sense to them. The thing I hate most about textbooks is when authors talk about something really intriguing and then handwave it by saying "we'll come back to this later after we establish <i>XYZ</i> fundamentals," as if my feeble brain couldn't possibly comprehend what lies ahead without their handholding and guidance. Let <em>me</em> take charge of my own learning, at my own pace.</p>

<main class="node" id="better-for-persuasion">
  <h3>Nonlinearity is more persuasive</h3>
  <p>If you're tring to persuade someone of something, chances are they'll have the same questions and concerns you had when you were coming up with your argument, but in a different order. If your readers could satisfy their curiosity and doubts immediately by following the connections, wouldn't it make for a stronger and more persuasive essay than if those doubts had to linger and wait around for you to explain them several paragraphs later?</p>

  <h3>Nonlinearity is better for including side notes</h3>
  <figure>
    <blockquote>
      What is a parenthesis but an idea trying to escape? What is a footnote but an idea that jumped off a cliff?
    </blockquote>
    <figcaption>—Ted Nelson, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=En_2T7KH6RA">on the folly of paper</a></figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>In traditional essays, footnotes, parentheses, and other digressions are tacked onto linear paragraphs as a second thought. Even if the author has interesting things to say about them, it's hard to go into more depth because they're treated like they burden the understanding of the main point because they're optional and are supposed to be periphery.</p>

  <p>For example, footnotes at the bottom of pages can't be elaborated on without invading the whole page. And parentheses― well― they're <em>the worst</em>. Parentheses in the middle of a sentence <span class="text-muted">(like this one for example― I'm hoping this will help me illustrate my point about how much I hate them. They suck. A lot. Do you see how much I hate them yet?)</span> can get so incredibly long that at the end of it, you forget what the start of the sentence was.</p>

  <p>In a nonlinear essay, we can treat side notes as first-class citizens that can connect to other ideas, and authors can digress to their hearts content. What's more, we can indicate that they're side notes so that if the reader isn't interested in them, they don't have to follow the side note's connections if they don't want to.</p>

  <h3>How should we present non-linear essays?</h3>
  <p>Though I'm sure this isn't the first linear essay in the world, I haven't seen any and they're certainly not commonplace. That means there are a lot of open design questions about how we should write and present linear essays, and I definitely don't presume that the way I present this essay is the best.</p>

  <h3>Nonlinear essays can be exportable mind palaces</h3>
  <p>Mind palaces traditionally take shape inside one's mind and never leave it. But does it have to be that way? If we took a traditional essay, created "rooms" for each of its main points and provide some imagery to go along with them, we've essentially made a kind of mind museum. We could have readers imagine themselves going through this museum, maybe by showing them an actual map, which would give them the same visual and spatial memory benefits that a mind palace has while reading our essay.</p>
  
  <p>Imagine this: A big room might hold an important argument, with a centerpiece under a spotlight in the middle illustrating a main point you're trying to make. And just as rooms in a museum can connect to many other rooms, parts of nonlinear essays can connect to many other parts, so to go from one idea to a related idea, you simply walk to the room you're interested in.</p>

  <h3>An essay in the form of Dwarf Fortress</h3>
  <p>My first idea when I thought of "exportable mind palaces" was something like Dwarf Fortress, where you'd have an ASCII map to explore and could interact with objects and NPCs. These objects and NPCs would represent and convey the ideas you want to get across in your essay. Maybe you'd have a quest to collect artifacts in the museum or something, so you'd be gamifying your essay somehow.</p>

  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOO">MOOs</a> from the 90s are kind of similar to Dwarf Fortress in that many have an ASCII map to explore and NPCs and such, though they are primarily multiplayer. There are several examples of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOO#Research_MOOs">educational and research MOOs</a>, like MIT's <a href="https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~asb/papers/journal/convergence.html">MediaMOO</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diversity_University">Diversity University</a> which emulate spaces in a university or conference center. As far as I'm aware, there aren't any MOO museums <span class="muted">(MOOseums)</span>, but it would be interesting to have an essay in the form of a MOO.</p>

<main class="node" id="no-strict-order">
  <h3>Nonlinear essays should not mandate a reading order</h3>
  <p>We want the reader to be able to explore the essay, picking up on the things they're interested <a href="#better-for-learning" class="content-link">as they see fit</a>. We should write with the expectation that when the reader has finished reading about an idea, they can choose to read any other idea connected to it.</p>

  <p>We have to expect <em>some</em> order though; our essay has to introduce its thesis statement early on so the rest of the essay can be understood. Readers probably aren't going to jump from one node to another node that's not connected at all. If you represent connections with arrows, it's generally understood that if an arrow points from Idea A to Idea B, then reading A first helps you understand B better.</p>

<aside class="node" id="directional-connections">
  <h3>If an arrow points from Idea X to Idea Y, should we expect X to be read before Y?</h3>
  <p>Even if connections are unidirectional, I still think we should expect that some readers will follow connections the "wrong" way around, but as authors we shouldn't worry too much about it. If the reader follows an arrow backwards Idea Y to Idea X, the direction of the arrow implies that they might not fully understand X, even having read Y. If they really want to understand X immediately, they can simply backtrack and find a path through ideas that will give them the requisite knowledge to understand X.</p>

<main class="node" id="atomic-nodes">
  <h3>Nonlinear essays should have atomic nodes representing key points</h3>
  <p>To make it easy on the reader to jump around between ideas in the essay, each key point should be represented by a single node. Each node should have a header that summarizes the key point, and the rest of the content should stick to talking about that point. Readers should be able to understand the content after having arrived at it from any other node that refers to it, at least well enough to make decisions about which other connected nodes they'd want to read.</p>

<main class="node" id="as-mind-maps">
  <h3>Nonlinear essays should have visual connections, like mind maps</h3>
  <p>When an author writes a linear essay, they have to pidgeonhole their thought and argumentation process into a linear format. However, in a mind map, ideas flow and connect to other ideas in precisely the way the mind map creator came up with them. Since nonlinear essays seek to represent these connections as naturally as possible, a mind map is a great way to represent the connections between its parts. When writing the essay, the author simply has to clean up the mind map they used for brainstorming and elaborate on ideas that a reader needs an explanation of.</p>

<main class="node" id="no-getting-lost">
  <h3>It's easy to get lost in linear writing</h3>
  <p>When there's a gap between parts of a linear essay that are connected to each other, it's really easy to get lost. If the author didn't <span class="text-muted">(or can't)</span> hyperlink to the point they were referring to, the reader has to manually find the relevant section if they feel they need more reminding that the glue sentences provide. Then if the reader wants to come back, there's never a link to places that refer to the current section, so they have to go <em>find</em> where they were originally.</p>

  <p>If you have a visual connection between connected ideas, like a line in a mind map, you just can follow the line from either end. Moving back and forth between parts of an essay is easy.</p>

<main class="node" id="no-glue-sentences">
  <h3>Nonlinear essays need less glue</h3>
  <p>When writers of linear essays bring up a point from an earlier paragraph and elaborate more on it several paragraphs down, they have to write glue sentences to remind the reader that they were talking about it earlier and transition the reader from an unrelated paragraph. In nonlinear essays, there are no arbitrary disconnects between points that refer to each other. This leads to fewer glue sentences since any two related ideas are connected visually― instead of needing the author to repeat themselves, the reader can just follow the connection.</p>

  <h3>Mind maps help you organize nonlinear thinking</h3>
  <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map">mind map</a> is a great way of diagramming nonlinear relationships between facts, ideas, and questions you encounter when you think deeply about something. Rather than writing them all linearly from the top of a page to the bottom, you can jot those ideas down wherever you'd like on the page and draw connections between related ideas.</p>

  <p>When you're done you not only have a record of your ideas, but also a visual representation of what ideas are related to each other, and it helps you remember <em>how you got to those ideas</em> in the first place.</p>

  <h3>Mind maps as lecture notes</h3>
  <p>I use mind maps to take notes in meetings and lectures, writing down questions and thoughts I have about the lecture content as connections to the notes I write down. If something comes up later in the lecture that answers the question (even partially), I can connect up later notes to that question and be more informed when I'm thinking about that question later.</p>

<main class="node" id="mind-palace">
  <h3>Mind palaces use spatial structure to help you remember things</h3>
  <p>
    The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci">mind palace technique</a> helps you remember a lot of things at once by taking advantage of your spatial and visual memory, and it revolves around an imaginary palace with stuff in it to remind you of what you need to remember. For example if you want to remember to buy eggs later to bake a cake:
    <ol>
      <li>Imagine you're in a room inside a palace <span class="text-muted">(or house, apartment, etc.)</span></li>
      <li>Imagine something absurd that's related to what you're trying to remember, like an elephant-sized cake with eggs all over the side, and someone's written "EGG" on all the eggshells.</li>
      <li>Later when you imagine yourself in the palace again, you'll remember this wacky imagery of a giant cake with eggs on it and know you need to buy eggs.</li>
    </ol>
    If you need to remember a large number of things, putting them in one mind palace and walking though it helps you remember them all. This technique works really well because it's a lot easier for the brain to remember a place <span class="text-muted">(even an imaginary one)</span> than a bunch of abstract ideas and facts.

  <h3>Drawings as mind palaces</h3>
  <p>I drew a lot in school, only half-paying attention to what was going on. It turns out if my whole attention isn't focused on just drawing, then when imagine what I was drawing later, I can actually remember what was going on in the lecture when I drew it. Because of this, I have a drawing somewhere of a little country home which reminds me of copyright law, strangely enough.</p>

  <h3>Minecraft as a mind palace</h3>
  <p>My friends and I built up a Minecraft world over several years, and one day I was wandering idly through a village we had built while they were discussing final exams on a Discord call. Years later, I ran through the same village again, and I remembered exactly what questions on the exam they were talking about because I had associated that memory with a particular spot in the village.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, I no longer remember because shortly after realizing that you could use Minecraft as a mind palace, the memory of this epiphany was stronger than the one about the exam, so that memory has been replaced. There are some limits to the mind palace after all.</p>

  <p>What annoys me about that scene is that even though Drs. Watson and Stapleton talk about how the mind palace is supposed to take the form of a location, what you see is phrases and pictures randomly swirling around Sherlock instead.</p>
