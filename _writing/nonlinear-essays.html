  <h3>Cognition and learning are nonlinear</h3>
  <p>Oftentimes, learning about a topic or brainstorming an idea doesn't follow a linear path. If you've ever <a href="https://xkcd.com/214/">lost yourself for hours on Wikipedia</a> following links that look interesting, sometimes you go into depth learning about one thing, then you backtrack and learn some more about another thing you saw, and in the end you end up with a sprawling of web of related information.</p>

  <p>Or when you're brainstorming, you'll often have ideas and questions that pop up all at the same time, and so you'd write them all down, focus on one idea, then come back to another when you're done. And sometimes down the road you realize some ideas are related to each other, so ultimately everything's interconnected one way or another.</p>

  <p>If you're always railroaded into following a linear path, you wouldn't have the freedom to explore ideas as they come naturally. You couldn't jump around to stuff that interests you. It'd be like being forced to read recipe authors' life stories on cooking websites, or having to read the whole Wikipedia article before getting to the section you care about.</p>

  <h3>Essays should reflect how we think</h3>
  <p>If the way we arrive at some knowledge or an argument is nonlinear, why do we write essays about them linearly? Here we in the Age of Computers, yet all we can do is emulate the the same 5-paragraph essays we hated from grade school. Essays should reflect the way we think and how we get to the ideas that we have, and invite the reader to journey through those ideas just as naturally as we created them.</p>

  <p><strong>What I want is more nonlinear essays where the connections between ideas are presented up front, and readers can choose the order in which they read the text as it interests them.</strong></p>

  <p>In other words, A nonlinear essay gives readers the freedom to read what interests them the most in the moment. Standing at one part of the essay, they can visually see what other ideas are connected to the current one and <em>choose</em>. If they have burning questions about something and want to know more about a certain topic, they shouldn't have to wait for the author to explain some other idea and come back to it!</p>

  <h3>Nonlinearity is better for learning</h3>
  <p>Readers absorb knowledge better when they choose a path that makes the most sense to them. The thing I hate most about textbooks is when authors talk about something really intriguing and then handwave it by saying "we'll come back to this later after we establish <i>XYZ</i> fundamentals," as if my feeble brain couldn't possibly comprehend what lies ahead without their handholding and guidance. Let <em>me</em> take charge of my own learning, at my own pace.</p>

<main class="node" id="better-for-persuasion">
  <h3>Nonlinearity is more persuasive</h3>
  <p>If you're tring to persuade someone of something, chances are they'll have the same questions and concerns you had when you were coming up with your argument, but in a different order. If your readers could satisfy their curiosity and doubts immediately by following the connections, wouldn't it make for a stronger and more persuasive essay than if those doubts had to linger and wait around for you to explain them several paragraphs later?</p>

  <h3>Nonlinearity is better for including side notes</h3>
  <figure>
    <blockquote>
      What is a parenthesis but an idea trying to escape? What is a footnote but an idea that jumped off a cliff?
    </blockquote>
    <figcaption>—Ted Nelson, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=En_2T7KH6RA">on the folly of paper</a></figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>In traditional essays, footnotes, parentheses, and other digressions are tacked onto linear paragraphs as a second thought. They're treated as second-class citizens because they're not part of the main point, and even if the author has interesting things to say about them, <em>it's hard to go into more depth about them because they're treated as second-class</em>.</p>

  <p>Footnotes at the bottom of pages can't be elaborated on without invading the whole page. And parentheses― well― they're <em>the worst</em>. Parentheses in the middle of a sentence <span class="text-muted">(like this one for example― I'm hoping this will help me illustrate my point about how much I hate them. They suck. A lot. Do you see how much I hate them yet?)</span> can get so incredibly long that at the end of it, you forget what the start of the sentence was.</p>

  <p>In a nonlinear essay, we can treat side notes as first-class citizens that can connect to other ideas, and authors can digress to their hearts content. What's more, we can indicate that they're side notes so that if the reader isn't interested in them, they don't have to follow the side note's connections if they don't want to.</p>

  <h3>Mind maps help you organize nonlinear thinking</h3>
  <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map">mind map</a> is a great way of diagramming nonlinear relationships between facts, ideas, and questions you encounter when you think deeply about something. Rather than writing them all linearly from the top of a page to the bottom, you can jot those ideas down wherever you'd like on the page and draw connections between related ideas.</p>

  <p>When you're done you not only have a record of your ideas, but also a visual representation of what ideas are related to each other, and it helps you remember <em>how you got to those ideas</em> in the first place.</p>

  <p>In a way, the visualness of the mind map means it can act as a mind palace, since all your ideas are in a certain arrangement and you can often remember the structure later and remember what the ideas were.</p>

  <h3>Mind maps as lecture notes</h3>
  <p>I use mind maps to take notes in meetings and lectures, and I write down the questions and thoughts I have about the lecture content as connections to the notes I write down. If something comes up later in the lecture that answers the question (even partially), I can connect up later notes to that question and be more informed when I'm thinking about that question later.</p>

<main class="node" id="mind-palace">
  <h3>Mind palaces use spatial structure to help you remember things</h3>
  <p>
    The <b>mind palace technique</b> helps you remember a lot of things at once by taking advantage of your spatial and visual memory, and it revolves around an imaginary palace with stuff in it to remind you of what you need to remember. For example if you want to remember to buy eggs later to bake a cake:
    <ol>
      <li>Imagine you're in a room inside a palace <span class="text-muted">(or house, apartment, etc.)</span></li>
      <li>Imagine something absurd that's related to what you're trying to remember, like an elephant-sized cake with eggs all over the side, and someone's written "EGG" on all the eggshells.</li>
      <li>Later when you imagine yourself in the palace again, you'll remember this wacky imagery of a giant cake with eggs on it and know you need to buy eggs.</li>
    </ol>
    If you need to remember a large number of things, putting them in one mind palace and walking though it helps you remember them all. This technique works really well because it's a lot easier for the brain to remember a place <span class="text-muted">(even an imaginary one)</span> than a bunch of abstract ideas and facts.

    <h4>Drawing in class</h4>
    <p>I used to draw a lot in class, half-paying attention to what was going on. It turns out if my whole attention isn't focused on just drawing, then when imagine what I was drawing later, I can actually remember what was going on in the lecture when I drew it. Because of this, I have a drawing somewhere of a little country home which reminds me of copyright law, strangely enough.</p>

    <h4>Minecraft as a mind palace</h4>
    <p>My friends and I built up a Minecraft world over the course of several years, and one day I was wandering idly through a village we had built up when my friends were discussing final exams on a Discord voice call. A few years later, I ran through the same village again, and I remembered exactly what questions on the exam they were talking about because I had associated that memory with a particular spot in the village.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, I no longer remember because shortly after realizing that you could use Minecraft as a mind palace, I found that the memory of this epiphany was stronger than that of the conversation about the exam, so the memory has been replaced with another. So there are some limits to the mind palace.</p>

    <p>The mind palace was featured <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FSKTndbwVo">in Sherlock</a> a few times, though it doesn't represent how it would be done in practice. <span class="text-muted">(At least, not how I do it.)</span></p>
